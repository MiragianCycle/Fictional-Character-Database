    <h1 class="mb-4">How to Use Character Database</h1>
    
    <p class="lead">Welcome to Character Database! This tool is designed to help writers keep track of their characters and their development throughout a story. Here's how to get the most out of it:</p>

    <h2 class="mt-5 mb-3">1. Adding Characters</h2>
    <p>Start by adding your characters to the database. On the home page, you'll find a form to enter a character's name and description. This is your chance to give a brief overview of who they are.</p>

    <h2 class="mt-4 mb-3">2. Character Arcs</h2>
    <p>Once you've added a character, you can define their arc. This is broken down into three acts, mirroring the typical three-act structure of many stories. For each act, you'll enter:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Self-Esteem:</strong> How the character views themselves (scale of 0-5)</li>
        <li><strong>Social Reputation:</strong> How others view the character (scale of 0-5)</li>
    </ul>
    <p>The tool will calculate a Psychological Index for each act, which is the difference between Self-Esteem and Social Reputation. This can help you track your character's internal conflicts and growth.</p>

    <h2 class="mt-4 mb-3">3. Relationships</h2>
    <p>You can also define relationships between characters. This includes the type of relationship and its intensity on a scale of 1-10. This feature can help you keep track of complex character dynamics in your story.</p>

    <h2 class="mt-4 mb-3">4. Comparing Characters</h2>
    <p>Use the Compare Characters feature to see how different characters' arcs progress side by side. This can be particularly useful for ensemble casts or for comparing protagonists and antagonists.</p>

    <p class="mt-5">Remember, this tool is here to assist your creative process, not to constrain it. Use it in whatever way best supports your writing. Happy storytelling!</p>
